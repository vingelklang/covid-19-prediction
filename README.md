# Predicting the Growth and Trend of COVID-19 Pandemic

This study applies an improved mathematical model to analyse and predict the growth of the epidemic. An ML-based improved model has been applied to predict the potential threat of COVID-19 in countries worldwide. We show that using iterative weighting for fitting Generalized Inverse Weibull distribution, a better fit can be obtained to develop a prediction framework. This has been deployed on a cloud computing platform for more accurate and real-time prediction of the growth behavior of the epidemic. Interactive prediction graphs can be seen at the following links:

2. Dynamic LSTM model: https://collaboration.coraltele.com/covid2/.
3. Multi-peak dynamic model*: https://shreshthtuli.github.io/projects/covid/.

**\* This model is also being used by the National Health Service (NHS) of the UK.**

## Quick installation of real-time prediction webapp

To install and run the dynamic real-time prediction webapp on your server run the following commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/shreshthtuli/covid-19-prediction.git
$ mv covid-19-prediction covid
$ chmod +x run.sh
$ ./run.sh
```
To access your server go to $HOSTNAME/covid/ from your browser. The webapp is hosted on https://shreshthtuli.github.io/projects/covid/ where graphs get updated daily based on new data.

## Dataset

We use the <i>[Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/)</i> dataset for predicting number of new cases and deaths in various countries.

## Model contributions

### Weibull Distribution
The model uses weibull distribution with the following function:

</div>

### Robust Curve Fitting
The model uses robust curve fitting as described in \[1\]. This is to give low weightage to outliers for curve fitting. The iterative loop of robust curve fitting is shown below.

</div>

### Dynamic Parameter Updates
The model uses LSTM model to calculate the coefficients of the weibull distribution as described in \[2\]. This is to adapt to the data and give higher weightage to recent data.

### Mixed Weibull distribution
The model uses mixed weibull model to handle multiple peaks where each peak is modelled using a separate weibull distribution. This is summation of upto four weibull functions as described before but with same <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\beta"/> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\gamma"/> values to share the trend of the virus in a country.
